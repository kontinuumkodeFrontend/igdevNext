            IGS is the data controller for the information you provide during
            the process unless otherwise stated. If you have any queries about
            the process or how we handle your information please contact us at 
            <a href="mailto:info@ig-smart.com">info@ig-smart.com</a>.
            <h6 >What will we do with the information you provide to us?</h6>
            All of the information you provide during the process will only be
            used for the purpose of progressing your application, or to fulfil
            legal or regulatory requirements if necessary. We will not share any
            of the information you provide during the recruitment process with
            any third parties for marketing purposes or store any of your
            information outside of the European Economic Area. The information
            you provide will be held securely by us and/or our data processors
            whether the information is in electronic or physical format. We will
            use the contact details you provide to us to contact you to progress
            your application. We will use the other information you provide to
            assess your suitability for the role you have applied for.
            <p className="p-color">What information do we ask for, and why?</p>
            We do not collect more information than we need to fulfil our stated
            purposes and will not retain it for longer than is necessary. The
            information we ask for is used to assess your suitability for
            employment. You don’t have to provide what we ask for but it might
            affect your application if you don’t.
            <p className="p-color">Application stage</p>
            If you use our online application system, this will be collected by
            a data processor on our behalf (please see below). We ask you for
            your personal details including name and contact details. We will
            also ask you about your previous experience, education, referees and
            for answers to questions relevant to the role you have applied for.
            Our recruitment team will have access to all of this information.
            You will also be asked to provide equal opportunities information.
            This is not mandatory information – if you don’t provide it, it will
            not affect your application. This information will not be made
            available to any staff outside of our recruitment team, including
            hiring managers, in a way which can identify you. Any information
            you do provide, will be used only to produce and monitor equal
            opportunities statistics.
            <p className="p-color">Shortlisting</p>
            Our hiring managers shortlist applications for interview. They will
            not be provided with your name or contact details or with your equal
            opportunities information if you have provided it.
            <p className="p-color">Assessments</p>
            We might ask you to participate in assessment days; complete tests
            or occupational personality profile questionnaires; and/or to attend
            an interview – or a combination of these. Information will be
            generated by you and by us. For example, you might complete a
            written test or we might take interview notes. This information is
            held by IGS. If you are unsuccessful following assessment for the
            position you have applied for, we may ask if you would like your
            details to be retained in our talent pool for a period of six
            months. If you say yes, we would proactively contact you should any
            further suitable vacancies arise.
            <p className="p-color">Conditional offer</p>
            If we make a conditional offer of employment we will ask you for
            information so that we can carry out pre-employment checks. You must
            successfully complete pre-employment checks to progress to a final
            offer. We are required to confirm the identity of our staff, their
            right to work in the United Kingdom and seek assurance as to their
            trustworthiness, integrity and reliability. You will therefore be
            required to provide:
            <ul className="arrow mt-4 mb-3">
              <li>
                Proof of your identity – you will be asked to attend our office
                with original documents, we will take copies.
              </li>
              <li>
                Proof of your qualifications – you will be asked to attend our
                office with original documents, we will take copies.
              </li>
              <li>
                You will be asked to complete a criminal records declaration to
                declare any unspent convictions.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will provide your email address to the Government Recruitment
                Service who will contact you to complete an application for a
                Basic Criminal Record check via the Disclosure and Barring
                Service, or Access NI, which will verify your declaration of
                unspent convictions.
              </li>
              <li>
                We will contact your referees, using the details you provide in
                your application, directly to obtain references
              </li>
              <li>
                We will also ask you to complete a questionnaire about your
                health. This is to establish your fitness to work. This is done
                through a data processor (please see below).
              </li>
            </ul>
            If we make a final offer, we will also ask you for the following:
            <ul className="arrow mt-3">
              <li>Bank details – to process salary payments</li>
              <li>
                Emergency contact details – so we know who to contact in case
                you have an emergency at work
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p className="p-color mt-2"><b>Post start date</b></p>
            Some roles require a higher level of security clearance – this will
            be clear on the advert. If this is the case, then you will be asked
            to submit information via the National Security Vetting process to
            HMRC. HMRC will be the data controller for this information. HMRC
            will tell us whether your application is successful or not. If it is
            unsuccessful, IGS will not be told the reason(s) why but we might
            need to review your suitability for the role or how you perform your
            duties. Our Code of Conduct requires all staff to declare if they
            have any potential conflicts of interest, or if they are active
            within a political party. If you complete a declaration, the
            information will be held on your personnel file.
            <p className="p-color">Use of data processors</p>
            Data processors are third parties who provide elements of our
            recruitment service for us. We have contracts in place with our data
            processors. This means that they cannot do anything with your
            personal information unless we have instructed them to do it. They
            will not share your personal information with any organisation apart
            from us. They will hold it securely and retain it for the period we
            instruct.
            <p className="p-color">How long is the information retained for?</p>
            If you are successful, the information you provide during the
            application process will be retained by us as part of your employee
            file for the duration of your employment plus 6 years following the
            end of your employment. This includes your criminal records
            declaration, fitness to work, records of any security checks and
            references. If you are unsuccessful at any stage of the process, the
            information you have provided until that point will be retained for
            6 months from the closure of the campaign. Information generated
            throughout the assessment process, for example interview notes, is
            retained by us for 6 months following the closure of the campaign.
            Equal opportunities information is retained for 6 months following
            the closure of the campaign whether you are successful or not.
            Vacancy Filler will provide us with management information about our
            recruitment campaigns. This is anonymised information which tells us
            about the effectiveness of campaigns, for example, from which source
            did we get the most candidates, equal opportunities information for
            monitoring purposes. This anonymised information will be retained
            for 6 years from the end of the campaign.
            <p className="p-color">How we make decisions about recruitment?</p>
            Final recruitment decisions are made by hiring managers and members
            of our recruitment team. All of the information gathered during the
            application process is taken into account. You are able to ask about

            IGS tries to be as open as it can be in terms of giving people

            contacting the Information Governance department.
            <h3 className="mt-4 mb-3">Disclosure of personal information</h3>
            In many circumstances we will not disclose personal data without
            consent. However, when we investigate a complaint, for example, we
            will need to share personal information with the organisation
            concerned and with other relevant bodies. You can also get further
            information on:
            <ul className="arrow mt-3">
              <li>
                agreements we have with other organisations for sharing
                information;
              </li>
              <li>
                circumstances where we can pass on personal data without consent
                for example, to prevent and detect crime and to produce
                anonymised statistics;
              </li>
              <li>
                our instructions to staff on how to collect, use and delete
                personal data; and
              </li>
              <li>
                how we check that the information we hold is accurate and up to
                date.
              </li>
            </ul>
